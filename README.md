# Lunch-Checker-Too-Much-or-Just-Right
This is my Assignment 1 submission for the Angular course on Coursera, developed using AngularJS version 1. The project, titled 'Lunch Checker: Too Much or Just Right', serves as an interactive tool to help users assess their lunch portion sizes. Upon entering comma-separated lunch items into the provided textbox and clicking the 'Check If Too Much' button, the application provides feedback based on the quantity entered. If the number of items is less than or equal to 3, a message 'Enjoy!' is displayed, indicating an appropriate portion. Conversely, if the number exceeds 3, the message 'Too much!' alerts the user of a potentially excessive portion. Additionally, the application prompts users with a 'Please enter data first' message if the textbox is empty or contains only spaces. Developed following AngularJS best practices, this project demonstrates fundamental concepts of AngularJS development and lays the groundwork for further exploration in subsequent assignments.
