# Lunch-Checker-Too-Much-or-Just-Right
This is my Angular Course Assignment 1, using AngularJS v1. Built a 'Lunch Checker' app to evaluate lunch portions. Users input items, get feedback: 'Enjoy!' for â‰¤3 items, 'Too much!' for more, or 'Please enter data first' if empty. Developed adhering to AngularJS principles, laying a solid foundation for future assignments.
